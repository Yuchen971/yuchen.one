- Definition
	- A residual plot is a graph that shows the residuals on the vertical axis and the independent variable on the horizontal axis.
	- If the points in a residual plot are **randomly dispersed** around the horizontal axis, a linear regression model is appropriate for the data; otherwise, a nonlinear model is more appropriate.
